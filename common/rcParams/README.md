# Custom Matplotlib Runtime Configuration (rc) Parameters

These dictate the basic styling of every figure I produce. 
See the Matplotlib [documentation](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/customizing.html) for more information.

## Why deviate from Matplotlib's default styling?

- Increasing the size of text, lines, markers, ticks, etc. helps data and values stand out.
- Custom "mathtext" parameters ensure uniformity between figure and main body text of, for example a journal manuscript.
- High figure DPI ensures a high quality image on a publication, poster, etc.
 
I update many of these parameters as needed in most examples, but these usually serve as my baseline.
Consider these as suggestions or examples rather than strict rules since they reflect my own taste and use cases.
