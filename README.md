# Visualization Examples

This repository contains a [gallery](gallery/index.md) of figures I've created during the course of my graduate astrophysics career. 
Check out the Python scripts used to make each figure in the `examples/` folder.

## Structure

- `examples/` — Each subfolder contains code and output image for a single figure.
- `gallery/index.md` — A gallery overview showcasing all figures.
